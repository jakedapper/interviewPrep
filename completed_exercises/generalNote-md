HOW TO BUILD TWITTER type question

-no right answer
-every interviewer looking for a different answer - can ask, "twitter has a lot of features, is there anything you'd like me to focus on?"
-focus is on data model
-how would you build out a database? how to store tweets, users, etc.
-dont mention specific technologies - ex. "I would use react and redux and node and express" - GOOD: "I would use a web framework that could render a list of tweets, something conndicive to mobile..."
-draw stuff
-talk
-need to prove you can communicate complicated topics and voice what you're thinking
-immedieately respond and try to get more insight and give them what you're thinking

    GENERAL STRATEGY

    Identify two or three core features
    -draw out what the basic interface looks like
    --here's where trending tweets go, here's suggeted users to follow, here's the feed of users tweets, here's where you can tweet, here's a search bar
    --talk about what happens when users use something - when you click, what the database does
    --identify and address difficulties
    --retweets, what tweets to show to user when they first log in (alogithms used, time space complexity, what to cache)
    --solutions for scaling
    --caching
    --deployment options
    --create a load balancer - randomly assigns user making request to one of many identical servers (scaled horizontally)
    --server architecture
